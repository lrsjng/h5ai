# h5ai

[![license][license-img]][github] [![web][web-img]][web] [![github][github-img]][github]

A modern HTTP web server index for Apache httpd, lighttpd, nginx and Cherokee.
For bug reports and feature requests please use [issues][github-issues].

There was a [security flaw][cve] in versions 0.22.0 - 0.24.1 that was fixed in
0.25.0. If you are still using one of these versions you are advised to
upgrade.

## Install

Do **not** install any files from the `src` folder, they need to be
preprocessed to work correctly! Find a preprocessed package and detailed
install instructions on the [project page][web].

In short you have to take the following two steps:

* place folder `_h5ai` in the document root folder of the web server
* append `/_h5ai/public/index.php` to the end of the default index-file list
* make sure the php function `exec` and `passthru` are not disabled by `disable_functions` in `php.ini` if you want to enalbe the optional features such as "shell zip","shell tar" and "shell du"

## Build

There are installation ready packages for the latest [releases][release] and
[dev builds][develop]. But to build **h5ai** yourself either `git clone` or
download the repository. From within the root folder run the following
commands to find a fresh zipball in folder `build` (tested on linux only,
requires [`node 4.0+`][node] to be installed).

~~~sh
> npm install
> npm run build
~~~
